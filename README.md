# Hangman_Game
game of hangman

* How to run
	* Compile and run the .java file. Make sure a .txt file (should contain a list of words) is in the same directory. This .txt file contains all of the potential solutions to the game.
	* Currently the program only includes a single list of words to pick from.
	
* Things to add/change later
	* let user pick difficulty level (automatically loads an appropriate list of solutions)
		* adjust number of wrong guesses
		* limit the user to a certain amount of time before a guess must be made
	* visually display a hangman which matches the number of guesses remaining
	* godmode
