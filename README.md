# Hangman_Game
game of hangman

* How to run
	* Compile and run Game.java. Make sure a txt file (should contain a list of words) is in the same directory. This file contains all of the potential solutions to the game.
	* Currently the program only includes a single list of words to pick from.
  * The Menu class has been reserved for later use
	
* Things to add/change later
  * the "play again" feature has been temporarily removed and will be back when the new Menu class is finished
  * the pickWord() method exists in main method temporarily and will be moved when the new Menu class is finished
	* let user pick difficulty level (automatically loads an appropriate list of solutions)
		* adjust number of wrong guesses
	* visually display a hangman which matches the number of guesses remaining
	* godmode
